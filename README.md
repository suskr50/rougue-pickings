A PSD to HTML sample 


This a sample HTML, CSS, SASS code.  It was originally a project for a Skillcrush class I took. It is a one page sample site created 
from a PSD. THE PSD is only the desktop version but I modified the code to be responsive.It can be viewed on mobile devices as well 
as desktops. 

The class project part was just a desktop version of the PSD with a CSS style sheet.  When I modified the code I uses SASS, 
and made it responsive.
